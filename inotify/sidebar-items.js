initSidebarItems({"mod":[["ffi","Bindings for inotifyThere are four types of statics:__Flags__, to be passed to `inotify_init1()`; __Events__, that describe which events should be watched for (when calling `inotify_add_watch()`), and which event has occured (when returned by `read()`); __Options__, which can be added to the bit mask passed to `inotify_add_watch()`, to change default behavior; __Infos__, indicating further details of the event that occured (returned by `read()`). When events occur for monitored files and directories, those events are made available to the application as structured data that can be read from the inotify file descriptor using `read()`.When all file descriptors referring to an inotify instance have been closed (using `close()`), the underlying object and its resources are freed for reuse by the kernel; all associated watches are automatically freed.A programmer wanting to use inotify should also carefully read through the inotify(7) man page, which contains many caveats, warnings, and recommendations for proper, robust, and efficient usage of inotify."],["wrapper","Idiomatic wrapper for inotify"]]});
