initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Arg","The abstract representation of a command line argument used by the consumer of the library. Used to set all the options and relationships that define a valid argument for the program.This struct is used by the library consumer and describes the command line arguments for their program. Then evaluates the settings the consumer provided and determines the concret argument type to use when parsing.There are two methods for constructing `Arg`s, using the builder pattern and setting options manually, or using a usage string which is far less verbose. You can also use a combination of the two methods to achieve the best of both worlds.**NOTE*: Fields of this struct are **not** meant to be used directly unless absolutely required. 99.9% of the tasks can be performed without accessing these fields directly.Examples"]]});
